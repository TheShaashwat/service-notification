BEST Design Pattern for Notification Service (Spring Boot)

👉 Strategy Pattern + Factory Pattern
This combination is the BEST and industry-standard choice for a notification service.

✅ Strategy Pattern
    Each notification type (Email, SMS, Push) has its own logic
    No if-else or switch mess
    Easy to add WhatsApp / Slack / Webhook later
✅ Factory Pattern
    Decides which notification to send at runtime
    Keeps controller & service clean
    Follows Open–Closed Principle
💡 Amazon, Netflix, Uber, Swiggy use this exact approach

Controller → Service → Factory → Strategy (Email | SMS | Push)
